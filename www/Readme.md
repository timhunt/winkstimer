# Tim's Tiddlywinks Timer

[Tiddlywinks](http://www.etwa.org/) is an excellent game. If you don't already play, you should follow that link,
and learn. If you don't play Winks, then this App will be completely useless to you, because this app aspires to
be the best possible way to time a game of Winks.

When finished, hopefully this will end up in App stores. Until then,
it is a fairly standard [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) App, so you may be able to work
out how to build it and deploy it to your phone by following the Cordova docs.
